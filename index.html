    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
      
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
        learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
        movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email" target="_blank">sign up for our official email list now</a>.

        HTML was created by the oirginal "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Founders</h2>

      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of teechnical sophisitcation taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

        <p>
          Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and a principal author of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough To Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of  <a href="http://kravmaga.com/" target="_blank">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

        <p>
          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end devlopment, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        <p>
          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
